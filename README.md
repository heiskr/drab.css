# drab.css

An extremely boring set of CSS.
If you have a page of basic, unstyled HTML, and want to do almost no work, just pop this in.

## Goals

- Bare minimum number of changes on top of `normalize.css`.
- Almost no classes, just add boring style to basic HTML tags.

Use the `page` class to restrict the main portion of the page to a readable line length.

## Changes

1. Apply `border-box` sizing to all elements.
2. Apply system fonts.
3. Apply more common `line-height` and use an `8px` vertical rhythm.
4. Use consistent border sizes and styles.
5. Tighten left on list like elements.
6. Apply more common spacing on `table`s.
7. Use more common, consistent, and attractive colors.
8. Style and color buttons to look more like web buttons.
9. Change the look of caption text.
10. Make strikethroughs more obvious.
11. Soften the shape of big boxy elements.
12. Finally, limit width on a high element so text is more readable. (The only class!)
